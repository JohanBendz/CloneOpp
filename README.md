# CloneOpp - A lightning component to clone an opportunity with it's associated products
## Overview
A Lightning Component to clone an opportunity record with it's related opportunity line items. I came across many questions regarding this feature on Success Community and Salesforce product team still need some time to delivering this well needed feature. So, It made me think to create one and distribute this in the community.
